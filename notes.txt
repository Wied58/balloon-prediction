awk -F"," '{print $8","$1","$2","$3","$4","$5","$6}' balloon_data.raw > test_data.csv

1. What is up with alt scale on graph
2. graph descent path
3. get output in same format as input file
4. Can we get real time predictions during descent? - Would you like a real-time tracker for descent updates?
5. plot map
6. plot altitude





*******************************************

2nd try iterative development


1. Have timestamp, lat long and alt data from a weather balloon flight the data recorder was started before the balloon was released and long after the balloon landed and it may have traveled in a vehicle this loeaving a lot of non flight data in the set. I would like to read the csv, trim the non light data, place the results in a pandas from plot alt against the timestamp.
